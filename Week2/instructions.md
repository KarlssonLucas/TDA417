Q2.  Give an algorithm that removes all comments from a program. Assume that comments are written as ”(* … *)” and can be nested (i.e. ”(* a comment with (* another comment *) inside *)”). Write your algorithm in pseudocode if you like. What is the complexity of your algorithm?

Q3.  Write a program that reads a postfix expression (Links to an external site.) and evaluates it.

Q4.  Recall the following question from the quiz, about queues:

    "Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (queue) enqueue and dequeue operations. The enqueue operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the queue; the dequeue operations print out the return value. Which of the following sequence(s) can never occur?"
    Try to come up with a rule that tells if a sequence is possible or not.

Q5 (harder). The same as the previous question, but for stacks:

    "Suppose that an intermixed sequence of (stack) push and pop operations are performed. The pushes push the integers 0 through 9 in order; the pops print out the return value. Which of the following sequence(s) can never occur?"
    Try to come up with a rule that tells if a sequence is possible or not.
